# About Machnet

**Machnet** is a high-performance networking stack optimized for cloud VMs.  
We aim to make low-latency communication accessible and developer-friendly.

---

## 🚀 Our Mission

To empower developers with a fast, simple, and open-source alternative to legacy networking stacks — particularly in cloud-native environments and research contexts.
